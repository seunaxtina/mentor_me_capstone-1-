Mentor Me Capstone — Matching Algorithm & Methodology
Weighted Scoring Model v1

APPROACH: Rule-based weighted scoring (see research notes in report — chosen
over collaborative filtering / ML classification because there is no
historical match-outcome data to learn from, and a transparent, explainable
score is more defensible for a capstone review than a black-box model).

IMPORTANT — ON THE MENTOR/MENTEE DATA USED HERE:
No public dataset labels anyone as a "mentor" or "mentee" — that field does
not exist anywhere. The Stack Overflow 2020 survey is being used here purely
as a source of SYNTHETIC CANDIDATE PROFILES to test the algorithm's logic
before real platform data exists (this mirrors the "limited availability of
real mentorship datasets" risk named in the capstone brief). The "mentor
pool" below is built with a simple proxy rule (YearsCodePro >= 5) — this is
an assumption made for testing purposes only, NOT a claim that these
respondents are actual mentors. In the real platform, mentor/mentee pools
would come from explicit self-selection at sign-up ("I want a mentor" /
"I want to be a mentor"), not an experience-level filter. The scoring logic
itself (role overlap, experience gap, career-stage priority, goals
alignment) is designed to work identically once real self-selected data
replaces this synthetic pool — only the data source changes.

CRITERIA AND WEIGHTS (grounded in Objective 1 findings):
1. Role/skill alignment       — 30%  (Chart 1: gap is role-specific, not generic)
2. Experience gap             — 25%  (Chart 2: pipeline breaks matter more than raw seniority)
3. Career-stage priority      — 20%  (Chart 3: two retention-risk windows, 0-2y and 5-10y)
4. Goals/values alignment     — 15%  (Chart 5: JobFactors overlap reflects real stated priorities)
5. Practical fit              — 10%  (org size / logistics — lower weight, secondary to substance)
